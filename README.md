### Hi there, I'm Nicolas üëã

#### üéì Educational Background 
I'm currently a second-year software engineering student at McGill University. My academic journey has been fueled by a deep interest in technology and innovation, which I've been cultivating since high school. Throughout my years in high school and CEGEP, I was actively involved in robotics, laying a solid foundation for my technical skills.

#### üíº Professional Experience 
- **MDA, Canadarm3 Team**: I had the exciting opportunity to contribute to the Canadarm3 project at MDA, focusing on DevOps. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also gave me a glimpse into the complexities of space technologies.
- **Framework Venture Partners**: At FVP, I delved into the backend and frontend aspects of a PostgreSQL & Django database. Here, I integrated various Language Learning Models (LLMs) using the Transformers library and open-source models, which was both challenging and rewarding.

#### üöÄ Current Interests 
Startups & Innovation: Transitioning from robotics, I'm now deeply fascinated by the startup ecosystem. The dynamic nature of building and scaling startups excites me, and I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and learning opportunities in this space.

#### üíª Technical Proficiencies 
- **Languages**: Proficient in Python, Java, and CSS.
- **Tools & Technologies**: Experienced with Jenkins (Groovy) and familiar with DevOps practices.

#### üå± What I'm Learning 
I'm constantly exploring new technologies and expanding my skillset. Currently, I'm diving deeper into advanced Python frameworks and cloud technologies.

### üåü External Projects and Contributions

#### Quebec Engineering Competition Finale - Circus Staffing Website
As part of the finale for the Quebec Engineering Competition, I collaborated with a team of four to develop a website for a circus company. This project was a blend of creativity and technical expertise, aimed at showcasing our ability to build functional and innovative digital solutions.

##### My Contributions
My primary focus in this project was on developing an efficient alert system integrated into the website. This system was designed to enhance staff coordination by automating the process of sending staffing schedules. Key highlights of my role included:
- Implementing an alert system that could text staffing schedules to employees.
- Integrating email functionalities through various APIs for efficient communication.
- Collaborating closely with the team to ensure seamless integration of the alert system with the website's overall functionality.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Canadian Engineering Competitions Finale: Resource Allocation Challenge
In a team of four at the Canadian Engineering Competition, we faced the intricate challenge of resource allocation under scarcity constraints. The primary goal was to ensure that each country received at least one essential resource from their list of needs, despite limited availability.

##### Project Context
The competition involved devising multiple algorithms, each tailored to a unique aspect of resource distribution. My responsibility was to create an algorithm that distributes resources based on each country's individual needs and the overall availability, ensuring that every country would receive at least one "element" of the resources they required ‚Äî be it water, medicine, wood, etc.

##### My Contributions
As one of four team members, I crafted an algorithm that:
- Analyzed the needs and resource requests of each country using the data provided.
- Prioritized the allocation such that each country received at least one of the resources they needed, meeting the bare minimum requirement in the face of scarcity.
- Managed the selection of which specific resource to allocate to each country, optimizing the distribution to maximize the number of countries served.

##### Technical Approach
- **Data Analysis & Management**: Used `pandas` for data manipulation, assessing country needs and resource availability.
- **Algorithm Development**: Engineered a weighted algorithm to strategically allocate scarce resources.
- **Optimization & Testing**: Conducted numerous iterations to determine the ideal weights for the allocation variables, balancing the distribution across countries.

##### Disclaimer
This description abstracts the complexity of the task to comply with the competitive and confidential nature of the competition. The provided code is a high-level overview of the algorithmic approach I developed for resource distribution. Each team member worked independently on different algorithms, and mine focused on need-based allocation to ensure equitable distribution across countries.
