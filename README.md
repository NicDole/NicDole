Hi there, I'm Nicolas ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ Educational Background
  I'm currently a second-year software engineering student at McGill University. My academic journey has been fueled by a deep interest in technology and innovation, which I've been cultivating since high school. Throughout my years in high school and CEGEP, I was actively involved in robotics, laying a solid foundation for my technical skills.

ðŸ’¼ Professional Experience
  MDA, Canadarm3 Team: I had the exciting opportunity to contribute to the Canadarm3 project at MDA, focusing on DevOps. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also gave me a glimpse into the complexities of space technologies.
Venture Capital Firm: At a VC firm, I delved into the backend and frontend aspects of a PostgreSQL & Django database. Here, I integrated various Language Learning Models (LLMs) using the Transformers library and open-source models, which was both challenging and rewarding.

ðŸš€ Current Interests
  Startups & Innovation: Transitioning from robotics, I'm now deeply fascinated by the startup ecosystem. The dynamic nature of building and scaling startups excites me, and I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and learning opportunities in this space.

ðŸ’» Technical Proficiencies
  Languages: Proficient in Python, Java, and CSS.
  Tools & Technologies: Experienced with Jenkins (Groovy) and familiar with DevOps practices.

ðŸŒ± What I'm Learning
  I'm constantly exploring new technologies and expanding my skillset. Currently, I'm diving deeper into advanced Python frameworks and cloud technologies.

ðŸŒŸ External Projects and Contributions
Quebec Engineering Competition Finale - Staffing Website for a circus company
      As part of the finale for the Quebec Engineering Competition, I collaborated with a team of four to develop a website for a circus company. This project was a blend of creativity and technical expertise, aimed at showcasing our ability to build functional and innovative digital solutions.
    My Contributions:
      My primary focus in this project was on developing an efficient alert system integrated into the website. This system was designed to enhance staff coordination by automating the process of sending        staffing schedules. Key highlights of my role included:
          Implementing an alert system that could text staffing schedules to employees.
          Integrating email functionalities through various APIs for efficient communication.
          Collaborating closely with the team to ensure seamless integration of the alert system with the website's overall functionality.
